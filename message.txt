Your DroidBOX system and services are now being managed by Downie (GlasKodi) Group. 

We have taken over all Clak devices and will continue to provide movies and TV shows to boxes running a firmware version higher than 5.0 for the forseeable future. 

The service is being run at a minimum as this is not our full time endeavour. Every good thing comes to an end and Kodi is no different - if something breaks, nothing can be done and DO NOT CONTACT JACK - HE IS FINISHED!! 

A new update will be pushed in the coming weeks that will include a new interface and easier management, but if it fails, you will have to find another provider. 

Kind regards on behalf of Clak.
