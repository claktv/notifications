Thanks for choosing Clak.

Unfortunately the end has come for ClakPlayer, due to the demise of most popular Kodi add-ons.
It is now near-impossible to source content, the result of over-use and negative coverage
by the UK media which has made streaming a key target for anti-piracy groups.
Terrarium TV is a great alternative app for movies and TV shows and Live TV can be viewed
with Mobdro or UKTV Now. Paid options are also available elsewhere.
Please note these services have no connection to Clak.

Thanks for your understanding and co-operation.
